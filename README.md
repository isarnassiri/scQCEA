# Repository of Reference Cell-Type Specific Gene Sets
We used Human Protein Atlas database (version 21.0) to generate a repository of reference gene sets that are exclusively expressed in each cell type (van Dieken, et al., 2022). The normalized expression (NX) value was used to compare gene expression between tissues and select cell type-specific marker genes from RNA single-cell profiles. The repository includes 68 reference gene sets, and 2318 marker genes.
